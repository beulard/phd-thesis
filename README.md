# phd-thesis

My high energy physics PhD thesis about the COMET experiment at J-PARC. Submitted to Imperial College London for the degree of PhD.

The main topics of my research were:
- Realistic simulations of the experiment
- Development of a Generative Adversarial Network-based model to synthesize detector hits
- Estimation of the rate of atmospheric muons produced by cosmic rays reaching the detector and mimicking the signature of a $\mu-e$ conversion event

To build the PDF from source, you need texlive and a bunch of packages. I typically compile with `lualatex`.
