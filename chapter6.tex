\chapter{COMET Phase-I Sensitivity and Background Estimates}
\label{ch:phase-I_study}

With the framework to simulate backgrounds from atmospheric muons in place, we
can now combine the results into a complete sensitivity and background
simulation study for COMET Phase-I. In this chapter, we discuss our simulation
samples consisting of signal, decay in orbit (DIO), and atmospheric events, and
present our resulting expectations of the performance of Phase-I.

\section{Data samples}
Three simulation samples are produced for this study. A $\mu$--$e$ conversion
sample, a DIO sample and an atmospheric muon sample. All three are simulated in
the geometrical world shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bmc_geometry}. This geometry
differs from the older TDR design~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020} by
the number of counters in the CTH. Here, each layer of the CTH has 64 counters
instead of the original 48, which mainly affects the detector's geometrical
acceptance. In addition, we use the first-stage layout of the CTH, where both
layers are composed entirely of plastic scintillation counters. In contrast, the
final stage will have Cherenkov counters in the outer layer. As we shall see,
this has an important impact on the detector's ability to discriminate
atmospheric muons from conversion electrons.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\mu$--$e$}{Muon-to-electron} conversion} 

\subsubsection{Sample}

The signal sample is the most straightforward to produce. We initially generate
primary electrons with energy $E=\SI{104.97}{\MeV}$ uniformly inside the
stopping target disks. Their direction is isotropically distributed, as would be
the case in the conversion process. A uniform position distribution in each disk
is not realistic, because the actual distribution depends on where in the
stopping target the muons in the beam come at rest. To account for this, the
events are weighted according to the stopping positions of muons recorded in the
MC5 simulation. The weighting factor is determined from the relative probability
for a muon to stop at the sampled position, which is estimated by histogramming
the stopping positions in each disk.
Figure~\ref{fig:stopping_position_reweighting} shows the initially-sampled
uniform position distribution, the muon stopping position distribution from MC5,
and the result of event weighting. In total, $N_\mathrm{signal} =
2\times 10^6$ events are simulated to compose the signal sample.

% After applying geom cut of CTH trigger, how many remain?

        weighting them by the likelihood of a muon being bound in each bin. }
    \label{fig:stopping_position_reweighting}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Selection}
Signal events are selected based on detector acceptance criteria. We first
require fourfold coincidence in the CTH. Figure~\ref{fig:cydet_signal_event}
shows an example of a conversion event which passes this trigger criterion. The
fraction of events remaining defines the geometrical acceptance 
\begin{equation}
A_\mathrm{geom} \equiv  \frac{\text{fourfold coincidences}}{N_\mathrm{signal}}.
\end{equation}
In this simulation, the estimated geometrical acceptance is $A_\mathrm{geom} =
\SI{21}{\percent}$. In comparison, the TDR cites $A_\mathrm{geom} =
\SI{26}{\percent}$ with the previous design of the CTH.


% Reconstruction
We do not fully simulate the reconstruction of signal electron trajectories in
the CDC. In order to approximate the effect of reconstruction uncertainties, a
smearing is applied to the true momentum of each track. The reconstructed
momentum is estimated as $p_r = p_t + x$, where $p_t$ is the true momentum of
the electron as it enters the CDC, $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$, and $\sigma
= \SI{200}{\keV/\clight}$ is the expected momentum resolution of the CDC. Since
tracks are not properly reconstructed, we do not apply any track quality cuts to
select events but instead weight the signal sample by the associated acceptance
factor from Table~\ref{tab:acceptance} to account for the rejection of some
events.

In this simulation sample, the initial time for each event does not correspond
to the realistic time distribution of the $\mu$--$e$ conversion process. Hence,
events are not selected based on whether they reach the detector within the
trigger time window, but we weight the sample by the trigger time window
efficiency factor instead. Similarly, the sample is weighted by the trigger and
data acquisition efficiency factors to account for the loss of acceptance from
hardware effects. Table~\ref{tab:acceptance} lists the values of these
efficiency factors.


\subsection{Muon decay in orbit}
\subsubsection{Sample}
The DIO sample is similar to the signal sample in that the initial position
of signal and DIO electrons is identically distributed. Hence, we also sample
uniformly in the stopping target disks and then weight the events according to
the MC5 stopping position distribution. Similarly, the direction of DIO
electrons is sampled isotropically. The energy distribution is thus the only
difference between the two samples.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Momentum spectrum of electrons in the DIO sample.}
    \label{fig:czarnecki_spectrum}
\end{figure}

The theoretical energy spectrum of DIO electrons produced in aluminium muonic
atoms was investigated by Czarnecki et al.~\cite{czarnecki}. Here, we use their
proposed parametrisation of the energy spectrum around the DIO energy endpoint:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:czarnecki_param}
P(E_e) = a_5 \delta^5 + a_6 \delta^6 + a_7 \delta^7 + a_8 \delta^8,
\end{equation}
where $\delta \equiv E_\mu  - E_e - \frac{E_e^2}{2 m_\mathrm{Al}}$, $E_\mu =
\SI{105.194}{\MeV}$, $m_\mathrm{Al} = \SI{25133}{\MeV}$, with the values of the
four $a$ coefficients provided by the authors. This approximation is valid in
the region $E_e > \SI{85}{\MeV}$, which is sufficient to cover our whole DIO
sample. We use this spectrum parametrisation to weight DIO events based on their
energy. Similarly to the position weighting procedure, DIO events are first
generated with a uniform energy distribution in the range $p \in [95,
110]~\si{\MeV/\clight}$, and then weighted according to the probability for a
DIO electron to have the sampled energy. Figure~\ref{fig:czarnecki_spectrum}
shows the momentum spectrum of DIO electrons before and after weighting.

The DIO sample is composed of $N_\mathrm{DIO} = 10^7$ events in total.
Figure~\ref{fig:muon_dio_in_cydet} shows an example of a potential background
event from DIO where an electron with an energy close to the conversion energy
flies into the CyDet system and activates the trigger.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Selection}
The selection of DIO events is identical to the selection of conversion events.
We require a fourfold coincidence in the CTH, and then apply a Gaussian smear to
the true momentum of the electron to approximate track reconstruction. The same
efficiency and acceptance factors as for signal events are applied to weight the
sample and determine the absolute background contribution from the DIO process.


\subsection{Atmospheric muons}

\subsubsection{Sample}

Atmospheric muon events are simulated as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:cosmic_event_sampling}. Two samples are produced, one around the
entire surface of the CRV and one more densely concentrated on its upstream and
downstream openings. Because of how rarely a sampled atmospheric event produces
signal-like features, the atmospheric dataset is the largest of the three, with
$1 \times 10^9$ events generated on the envelope and $1.4 \times 10^9$ on the
openings.

        Then, it produces a track in the CDC and a fourfold coincidence in the
        CTH. Importantly, the trajectory crosses the muon stopping target,
        making it more difficult to distinguish from the conversion signal. }
    \label{fig:cosmic_muon_bg_in_cydet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Selection}
As for signal and DIO events, atmospheric events must at least pass the fourfold
coincidence criterion. Unlike signal and DIO events, hit information from the
CDC is also used to select track candidates. Two criteria apply: the particle
must reach at least the 5th innermost layer of the CDC, but it should not hit
the outermost layer. Hence, we select tracks with sufficient transverse
momentum to be reconstructed, but reject tracks that either have too large a
momentum to be a signal event, or appear to enter the CDC from the outside. 

In addition, the hit positions are used to reconstruct the track using a helix
fit. The fitted trajectory should intersect the muon stopping target to pass the
selection. Figure~\ref{fig:cosmic_muon_bg_in_cydet} shows an example of such an
atmospheric event. The helix fit estimates the momentum of the particle, which
is used in the analysis stage. Hence, for this sample, we do not apply a
Gaussian smear to the true momentum but use the estimated momentum from the fit
instead.

\subsubsection{Rate estimation}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bmc_conversion_bg_rate}, the rate for each selected
event is estimated by backward MC simulation. The backward propagation and flux
sampling is repeated 5000 times for every event, which yields an average flux
and a statistical error shown in the results.


\subsection{Sample weighting}\label{sec:sample_weighting}
\sepfootnotecontent{fn:conv_br_norm}{The nuclear muon capture branching ratio appears in this
expression because the branching ratio of $\mu$--$e$ conversion is
conventionally normalised to $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture}$.}

Because they originate from different processes, the three MC samples must be
individually weighted in order to determine the absolute contribution from each.
The conversion and DIO processes both originate from the muons bound in the
stopping target, hence we can express the total number of expected conversion
and DIO electrons in terms of the total number of stopped muons $N_\mu$.
The number of signal electrons, as a function of the conversion branching
ratio $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{conversion}$, is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight_signal}
N_\mathrm{conversion} = 
N_\mu \, \mathcal{B}_\mathrm{conversion} \, 
\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} \, f_\mathrm{coherent},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} = 0.61$ is the branching ratio of nuclear
muon capture\sepfootnote{fn:conv_br_norm} and $f_\mathrm{coherent}=0.9$ is the
fraction of conversions that are coherent.

Similarly, the total number of DIO electrons can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
N_\mathrm{DIO} = N_\mu \, \mathcal{B}_\mathrm{DIO},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{DIO} = 1 - \mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} = 0.39$ is
the branching ratio of DIO. Our simulation sample, however, only covers the part
of the DIO spectrum where $E_e > \SI{95}{\MeV}$, so we cannot simply use
$N_\mathrm{DIO}$ as the sample weight. The proper weight is given by 
\begin{align}\label{eq:weight_dio}
N_\mathrm{DIO}^{p>\SI{95}{\MeV}} &= N_\mathrm{DIO} \, P(E_e > \SI{95}{\MeV}) \\\nonumber
&= N_\mathrm{DIO}\,\int_{\SI{95}{\MeV}}^{E_\mathrm{endpoint}} P(E_e)\,dE_e,
\end{align}
where $E_\mathrm{endpoint} = \SI{104.973}{\MeV}$ is the energy above which no
DIO electron can be produced. The integral term in this equation is estimated by
numerically integrating the Czarnecki parametrisation of
Equation~\ref{eq:czarnecki_param}.
%  to obtain $N_\mathrm{DIO}^{p>\SI{95}{\MeV}} = 0.67$ assuming $N_\mu = 1.5e16$.

In the case of atmospheric muons, the backward MC procedure yields an absolute
rate $R$ for each event. This rate can simply be integrated over the total
data acquisition time of the experiment $T_\mathrm{DAQ}$ to obtain the expected
event count:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight_atmospheric}
N_\mathrm{atmospheric} = \int_0^{T_\mathrm{DAQ}} R\,dt = R \times T_\mathrm{DAQ}.
\end{equation}

In the TDR, COMET Phase-I was estimated to reach its sensitivity goal for
$T_\mathrm{DAQ} = 146$~days. In this study, we keep this value fixed to be able
to compare our sensitivity and background estimates with the original study.
%This run time
%corresponds to $N_\mu = 1.5 \times 10^{16}$. In the subsequent analysis, we
%substitute these two values into
%Equations~\ref{eq:weight_signal},~\ref{eq:weight_dio}
%and~\ref{eq:weight_atmospheric} to weight each sample.



\subsubsection{Trigger time window efficiencies}
In order to take into account the trigger timing window, we assume that
atmospheric muons irradiate the detector with a uniform time distribution.
Hence, the time window efficiency factor is the average fraction of time when
the trigger is active:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\text{time window}^\mathrm{atmospheric} =
\frac{8}{9}\,\frac{1170 - 700}{1170} = \SI{36}{\percent}
\end{equation}
assuming the trigger window is between 700 and \SI{1170}{\ns}, and where the
factor $\frac{8}{9}$ arises from the bunch structure of the J-PARC main ring. In
contrast, the efficiency factor for conversion and DIO electrons
$\epsilon_\text{time window}^\text{conversion|DIO} = \SI{30}{\percent}$ is
smaller because the time distribution of bound muons is not uniform but peaks
around \SI{300}{\ns}, before the trigger becomes active (see
Figure~\ref{fig:timing_distributions}).



\section{Single event sensitivity}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SES}, the single event sensitivity (SES) is
defined as the value of the $\mu$--$e$ conversion branching ratio required for
the experiment to observe one signal event. It can be expressed in terms of the
experimental acceptance $A_{\mu-e}$ and the total number of muons stopped in the
stopping target $N_\mu$:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{SES} = 
\frac{1}{N_\mu\,A_{\mu-e}\,\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture}\,f_\mathrm{coherent}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} = 0.61$ and $f_\mathrm{coherent} = 0.9$.

In this simulation study, we found the geometrical acceptance $A_\mathrm{geom}$
of the CyDet with the new CTH layout to be reduced from \SI{26}{\percent} to
\SI{21}{\percent}. Hence, the net signal acceptance $A_{\mu-e}$ decreases from
\SI{4.1}{\percent} to \SI{3.3}{\percent}. On the other hand, the yield of
stopped muons per proton collision was estimated from the MC5 dataset to be
$R_{\mu / p} = 4.86 \times 10^{-4}$, which is slightly higher than the TDR
value. Overall, although the total number of bound muons is increased for the
same run time, it is outweighed by the decrease in acceptance. Keeping
$T_\mathrm{DAQ}$ fixed at 146 days, we obtain $N_\mu = 1.53 \times 10^{16}$,
hence our estimation of the COMET Phase-I sensitivity is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{SES} = 3.61 \times 10^{-15}.
\end{equation}


\section{Signal and background event counts}

After applying the efficiency factors and weighting each sample by the total
number of expected events as per Section~\ref{sec:sample_weighting}, we are able
to determine the absolute contribution from each source over a given data
acquisition period.

    \label{fig:log_spectra}
\end{figure}


The absolute event counts from conversion, DIO and atmospheric muon events are
plotted as a function of the reconstructed track momentum in
Figure~\ref{fig:log_spectra}. Note again that for conversion and DIO, $p$ is the
smeared momentum of the electron as it enters the CDC, whereas we use the
momentum reconstructed via a helix fit for atmospheric muon events.


In order to determine the effect of the CRV on the atmospheric background, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:log_spectrum_cuts_except_directionID}, we apply a weight to each
event based on whether it passed through the active material of the CRV. For
events that produce hits in the CRV, the weight is the assumed inefficiency of
the CRV: $1 - (\SI{99.99}{\percent}) = 10^{-4}$. Events that sneak into the
detector are given a weight of 1 since the CRV cannot veto them. Similarly, to
simulate the absence of the CRV, as in Figure~\ref{fig:log_spectrum_nocuts}, all
atmospheric muon events have a weight of 1, corresponding to a
\SI{0}{\percent}-efficient CRV.



\sepfootnotecontent{fn:bg_study_rmc}{ We chose not to show the radiative muon
    capture spectrum in our plots because the contribution from RMC is smaller
    than that of DIO by a factor of 5~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020}.
}



% However, by investigating where
% these background events come from, we will see that there are ways to identify
% some of them and reduce their contribution below the single-event threshold.

The momentum of the candidate track is one of the most important criteria in
distinguishing signal electrons from DIO or RMC\sepfootnote{fn:bg_study_rmc}
electrons, because the energy spectra of the latter two fall off sharply close
to the conversion energy. In Phase-I, the momentum window within which an event
is counted is $p \in [103.6, 106.0]\,\si{\MeV/\clight}$. This cut eliminates the
majority of DIO and RMC backgrounds. However, atmospheric background events
appear to be uniformly distributed in this range, making the cut ineffective in
rejecting them. 

Figure~\ref{fig:log_spectrum_nocuts} shows that in the absence of the CRV,
atmospheric backgrounds overwhelm the detector and outnumber conversion events
by three orders of magnitude in the momentum window. In the presence of the CRV,
and assuming an efficiency of \SI{99.99}{\percent}
(Figure~\ref{fig:log_spectrum_cuts_except_directionID}), atmospheric backgrounds
are suppressed by a factor $10^3$. However, their integrated count still exceeds
one, making the $\mu$--$e$ conversion search impossible unless there is an
additional way to identify them.


% For the atmospheric sample, we also reduce the background rate of certain events
% based on the primary particle ($\mu^-$ or $\mu^+$) and whether they hit the CRV.
% The first stage of the CTH, containing only scintillation counters and no
% Cherenkov counters, is unable to differentiate muons from electrons. Hence,
% signal-like tracks induced by sneaking atmospheric $\mu^+$ are a major source of
% backgrounds in this situation.

        track in the CDC, and flying through the muon stopping target. The
        anti-muon thus appears as a time-reversed signal-like event. }
    \label{fig:cosmic_antimuon_bg_in_cydet}
\end{figure}


So far, we have assumed that the CyDet system has no way of discriminating
between electrons, muons, and anti-muons. However, this is only partly true. At
a momentum of \SI{105}{\MeV/\clight}, an electron has a velocity close to the speed of
light, whereas a muon travels only at around $0.7 c$. This allows the two to be
distinguished when they pass through a Cherenkov detector with the right index
of refraction. The final stage of the CTH will have Cherenkov counters on the
outer layer, allowing electrons to be discriminated from muons. However, the
first stage of the CTH will be composed of only scintillation counters. Hence,
initially, the CTH by itself will not suffice in identifying atmospheric muon
backgrounds. We now investigate the signatures of atmospheric muons that sneak
into the CyDet system without being vetoed by the CRV, and try to determine how
impactful identifying the particle type is in lowering the background rate.



Negative atmospheric muons typically produce signal-like tracks in the CyDet by
scattering off a dense supporting element, and then mimicking the path of a
conversion electron emanating from the muon stopping target, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:cosmic_muon_bg_in_cydet}. Without a Cherenkov-counter layer in
the CTH, it is very difficult to identify this type of background. However, our
results indicate that these occur 5 to 10 times less frequently than backgrounds
from positive atmospheric muons.

Positive atmospheric muons can induce backgrounds by following the reverse path
of a conversion electron. An anti-muon in the longitudinal magnetic field would
usually gyrate in the opposite way to a negative particle, and hence the track
fitting algorithm should easily determine that it has the wrong charge. However,
if the anti-muon travels from the CTH to the muon stopping target instead of the
opposite, it then follows a time-reversed signal-like trajectory which seems to
gyrate identically to a negative particle produced in the disks, as illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:cosmic_antimuon_bg_in_cydet}. The only difference between
this trajectory and that of a negative particle is the order in which it flies
from the CDC to the CTH. Therefore, in the absence of a particle-identifying
CTH, one can only rely on timing information to identify this kind of background
event.

In order to lower the atmospheric background rate, the identification of
atmospheric $\mu^+$-induced backgrounds via time-of-flight information was
studied for COMET Phase-I. The principle is to determine the direction of the
track using timing information from the CDC and CTH. Depending on the direction
of the particle, hits in the CDC will either occur earlier or later than hits in
the CTH. Each track is fitted under two hypotheses: either the particle is a
negative electron flying from the muon stopping target to the CTH via the CDC,
or it is a positive muon doing the same in reverse. The quality of the resulting
fit depends on the hypothesis, and thus the difference in quality between the
two fits can be used to distinguish electrons from anti-muons. An early
simulation study of this method indicates that \SI{89}{\percent} of
$\mu^+$-induced backgrounds can be rejected using timing information, while
preserving \SI{87}{\percent} of signal events~\cite{moritsu}. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum_with_direction_id}, we use this result to show the
effect of $\mu^+$ identification on the background spectrum. The integrated
background event count from atmospheric muons is reduced to 0.48 in the momentum
window. Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum_with_cherenkov_pid} shows the effect of a
particle-identifying Cherenkov layer in the CTH, assuming an efficiency of
\SI{99}{\percent} and no negative effect on signal acceptance. The background
count falls to 0.08 for one signal event.

\subsection{CRV efficiency}

    \label{fig:bg_count_vs_crv_efficiency}
\end{figure}

The CRV efficiency determines the fraction of atmospheric events which can enter
the CyDet through the active parts of the CRV while not being vetoed. Although
we have assumed so far that the CRV successfully rejects \SI{99.99}{\percent} of
atmospheric muon events, this will not necessarily be realised in practice.
Figure~\ref{fig:bg_count_vs_crv_efficiency} shows the background event count as
a function of the CRV efficiency. An efficient CRV helps to reject the vast
majority of atmospheric backgrounds. An efficiency of at least
\SI{99.9}{\percent} seems necessary to suppress the background counts to fewer
than one. Beyond \SI{99.99}{\percent}, the contribution from sneaking events
becomes significant, and reducing the background rate is better tackled by means
of particle identification, such as with the Cherenkov CTH layer.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{ Summary of atmospheric background counts for

    \label{tab:bg_summary}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:bg_summary} summarises the atmospheric background event counts
for $T_\mathrm{DAQ}=146$~days under various run conditions. Obviously, one major
aspect of identifying atmospheric muons is the CRV, and the background rate
greatly depends on its efficiency.

The problem caused by sneaking muons is more subtle. However, it can still plague
the conversion search by producing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ signal-like events during
data acquisition. The most frequent sneaking backgrounds are produced by
anti-muons disguising as negative particles by flying from the detector to the
muon stopping target. These events can, however, be distinguished from
conversion electrons via a direction identification technique using timing
information from the CDC and CTH. Being able to identify \SI{89}{\percent} of
$\mu^+$-induced events in this manner reduces the background counts to 1.10 with
a \SI{99.9}{\percent}-efficient CRV or 0.48 with a
\SI{99.99}{\percent}-efficient CRV. 

Eventually, when the CTH reaches its final stage with an outer Cherenkov layer,
muons will be more effectively distinguished from electrons. If the CTH allows us
to reject \SI{99}{\percent} of all $\mu^\pm$ events, the background count could
be as low as 0.08, with a \SI{99.99}{\percent}-efficient CRV.
