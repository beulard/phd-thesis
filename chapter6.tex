\chapter{COMET Phase-I sensitivity and backgrounds}

With the framework to simulate backgrounds from atmospheric muons in place, we
can now combine the results into a complete sensitivity and background
simulation study for COMET Phase-I. In this chapter, we discuss our simulation
samples consisting of signal, decay in orbit (DIO), and atmospheric events, and
present our resulting expectations of the performance of Phase-I.

\section{Simulation setup}
Three simulation samples are produced for this study. A $\mu$--$e$ conversion
sample, a DIO sample and an atmospheric muon sample. All three are simulated in
the geometrical world shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bmc_geometry}. This geometry
differs from the outdated TDR design~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020}
by the number of counters in the CTH. Here, each layer of the CTH has 64
counters instead of the original 48.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\mu$--$e$}{Muon to electron} conversion sample} 

The signal sample is the most straightforward to produce. We initially generate
primary electrons with energy $E=\SI{104.97}{\MeV}$ uniformly inside the
stopping target disks. Their direction is isotropically distributed, as would be
the case in the conversion process. 

The uniform position distribution in each disk is not realistic, because the
actual distribution depends on where in the stopping target the muons in the
beam become bound. Hence, the events are weighted according to the MC5
simulation, where the muon beam was fully simulated from $10^9$ proton-on-target
collisions, and each stopping position was recorded. The weighting factor is
determined from the relative probability for a muon to stop at the sampled
position, which is estimated by histogramming the stopping positions in each
disk. Figure~\ref{fig:stopping_position_reweighting} shows the sampled uniform
position distribution and the resulting distribution after weighting.
In total, $N_\mathrm{signal} = 2\times 10^6$ events are simulated
to compose the signal sample.

\subsection{Muon decay in orbit sample}
The DIO sample is very similar to the signal sample in that the initial position
of signal and DIO electrons is identically distributed. Hence, we also sample
uniformly in the stopping target disks and then weight the events according to
the MC5 stopping position distribution. Similarly, the direction of DIO
electrons is sampled isotropically. The energy distribution is thus the only
difference between the two samples. 

The theoretical energy spectrum of DIO electrons produced in aluminium muonic
atoms was determined by Czarnecki et al.~\cite{czarnecki}. Their calculated
spectrum is used to determine an energy weighting factor for simulated DIO
events. DIO events are first generated with a uniform energy distribution, and
then weighted according to the relative likelihood for a DIO electron to have
the sampled energy. Figure~\ref{fig:dio_energy_reweighting} shows the weighted
energy distribution compared to the theoretical energy spectrum. \hl{FIGURE and

The time distribution of signal, DIO and atmospheric events is not realistically
simulated in this study. Instead, we apply an average timing window efficiency
weight to all events in order to estimate the total count integrated over
data-acquisition time.

\section{Single event sensitivity}
The single event sensitivity (SES) is defined as the value of the $\mu$--$e$
conversion branching ratio required for the experiment to observe one signal
event. It can be expressed in terms of the experimental acceptance $A_{\mu-e}$ and the
total number of muons stopped in the stopping target $N_\mu$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{SES} = \frac{1}{N_\mu\,A_{\mu-e}\,\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture}\,f_\mathrm{coherent}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} = 0.61$ is the branching ratio of nuclear
muon capture and $f_\mathrm{coherent} = 0.9$ is the fraction of conversions
expected to leave the nucleus in its ground state.

% Is it worth ELI5 here?
% The net signal acceptance $A_{\mu-e}$ is the product of various factors stemming
% from the experiment's design and inefficiencies in the processing,
% reconstruction and selection of candidate events. 

% How do we approach the fact that CTH geom has changed so our geom acceptance
% is lower?
In this study, the CTH trigger mechanism was simulated by finding events
involving a fourfold coincidence. The fraction of signal events which induce a
trigger is defined as the geometrical acceptance $A_\mathrm{geom}$. In our
simulation setup, the CTH contains 64 counters per layer, two layers
in each module, one module at the upstream end of the CDC and the other
downstream (256 counters in total). Our estimated geometrical acceptance is
$$
A_\mathrm{geom} \equiv \frac{\text{fourfold coincidences}}{N_\mathrm{signal}} = \SI{21}{\percent}.
$$
In comparison, the COMET Phase-I TDR~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020}
cites $A_\mathrm{geom} = \SI{26}{\percent}$ with the previous design of the CTH,
which had 48 counters per layer. This reduced acceptance worsens the sensitivity
of the experiment slightly. In this study, none of the other experimental
aspects that contribute to the net acceptance were changed, hence we use the
other factors of $A_{\mu-e}$ from the TDR, and only replace the value of
$A_\mathrm{geom}$ with the newly estimated one. Values of the acceptance
coefficients used in our study are shown in Table~\ref{tab:acceptance}. The net
signal acceptance using these factors is $A_{\mu-e} = 0.032$.

The number of muons stopped in the stopping target, $N_\mu$, is a function of
the COMET beam power, the target material, the design of the
transport system, and the total data-acquisition time. 
The target material sets the yield of
backward-going pions which will decay to muons of the right momentum to come at
rest in the muon stopping target. This, combined with the transport system,
determines the yield of stopped muons per proton collision $R_{\mu/p} \equiv
\frac{\text{muons stopped}}{\text{proton on target}}$. Here, we use the
MC5 dataset, a sample of $10^9$ POT collisions, to estimate $R_{\mu/p}=4.86
\times 10^{-4}$.
The beam power and data-acquisition time together determine the total number of proton
collisions that will occur. COMET Phase-I requires $N_\mathrm{POT} = 3.15 \times
10^{19}$ collisions in order to reach its sensitivity goal, corresponding to a
data-acquisition time of $T=146$ days.
These figures allow us to estimate the total number of stopped muons
$$N_\mu = R_{\mu/p} \times N_\mathrm{POT} = 1.56\times 10^{16},$$
which can be substituted into the SES formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:my_ses}
\mathrm{SES}
=\frac{1}{N_\mu\,A_{\mu-e}\,\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture}\,f_\mathrm{coherent}}
= 3.81\times10^{-15}.
\end{equation}
This value is slightly worse than the TDR estimation,
$\mathrm{SES}_\mathrm{TDR}=3\times 10^{-15}$, because of our lower geometrical
acceptance by the new CTH design.
