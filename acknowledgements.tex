\chapter*{Acknowledgements}



I acknowledge the important contributions from Noam Mouelle and Irene Andreou to
the model evaluation methods and results described in
Section~\ref{sec:quality_metrics}, and the fruitful discussions with Valentin Niess
about his original study of cosmic ray-induced backgrounds in COMET Phase-I and
his backward Monte Carlo simulation method.
