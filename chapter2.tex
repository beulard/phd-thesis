COMET (COherent Muon-to-Electron Transition) is a future muon-beam experiment
which will search for the muon-to-electron conversion process. Currently under
construction at the J-PARC facility in Tokai, Japan, its physics program will be
run in a two-stage approach, Phase-I and Phase-II. These two phases are expected
to be 100 and \numprint{10000} more sensitive to $\mu$--$e$ conversion,
respectively, than the current world-leading measurement conducted at the
SINDRUM II experiment~\cite{Bertl:2006up}. In order to reach these goals, the
COMET experiment is designed with strict requirements defined to efficiently
reject background events and thus push the sensitivity limit as high as
possible.

\section{Muon production}
Searching for $\mu$--$e$ conversion requires an intense source of muons. The
COMET experiment relies on the J-PARC accelerator facility to provide protons.
The proton beam hits a static graphite target to produce pions, which then decay
to muons. In order for the collision to produce a reasonable number of pions
while avoiding anti-proton production\footnote{
Anti-protons have the same charge as pions but travel more slowly for a given
momentum. Hence, they can produce delayed secondaries which hit the detector
system, which is a source of background as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:delayed_backgrounds}. A beam energy of \SI{8}{\GeV} is the
lower limit above which anti-proton production becomes kinematically allowed.
}, the protons in the beam have a kinetic energy of \SI{8}{\GeV}. 


\section{Experimental backgrounds}\label{sec:backgrounds}
The COMET experiment is specifically designed to be sensitive to a $\mu$--$e$
conversion signal, i.e.\ to eliminate as many sources of background as possible
while making sure to notice the process if it does occur. 

Observing $\mu$--$e$ conversion requires the production of an intense source of
muons which must be bound to atomic nuclei. COMET uses a proton beam from the
J-PARC main ring.


The COMET experiment will produce a
muon beam and direct it toward a static aluminium target to slow down and stop
the muons. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sm_backgrounds}, a bound muon can
undergo decay in orbit (DIO) or nuclear capture. 

\section{Design requirements}

The design of the COMET experiment is heavily angled toward suppressing
backgrounds to the $\mu$--$e$ conversion signal. Understanding the background
sources and their properties is key in making sense of the experimental design.

\section{The COMET beam}\label{sec:COMET_beam}


% The choice of target material directly influences how frequently high-energy
% electrons will be produced by these processes, and hence contributes in
% setting the maximum experimental sensitivity.

% This should go into the COMET section as these are specific to COMET and/or
% specifically addressed by the COMET design.
% Background events can be classified into three categories: intrinsic,
% beam-related, and cosmic ray-induced.

% Beam-related backgrounds come from impurities in the high-intensity muon beam.
% The specifics of the COMET beam and how these backgrounds are alleviated is
% discussed in Section~\ref{sec:COMET_beam}.

% Cosmic rays typically produce muons with a wide range of energies in the
% atmosphere which
