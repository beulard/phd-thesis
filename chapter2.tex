% Description and goals
COMET (COherent Muon-to-Electron Transition) is a future muon-beam experiment
designed to search for the muon-to-electron conversion
process~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020}. It is currently under
construction at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) facility
in Tokai, Japan. The goal of COMET is to be \numprint{10000} times more
sensitive to $\mu$--$e$ conversion than the current world-leading limit set by
the SINDRUM II experiment~\cite{Bertl:2006up}. 

% Requirements
\subsubsection{Requirements}
In order to reach its goal, the COMET experiment is designed with strict
requirements defined to make the conversion signal as clear as possible, while
efficiently rejecting background events. The essential requirements that define
the COMET experiment are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An intense muon source to probe the rare conversion process;
    \item A pulsed beam such that timing information can be used to reject backgrounds;
    \item Strict selection of charge and momentum of beam particles prior to
    reaching the detector;
    \item A tracking detector to search for the \SI{104.97}{\MeV} conversion signature.
\end{itemize}
These requirements and the design choices that were made to address them are
described in more detail in the rest of this chapter.

% Strategy
\subsubsection{Strategy}
COMET is planned to run in a staged approach such that the properties of the
newly designed beam can be finely understood before making the measurement.
COMET Phase-I has a double purpose, each fulfilled by a distinct detector
system. The StrECAL detector, composed of a straw-tube tracker and
electromagnetic calorimeter, will study the beam composition and timing
properties and increase our understanding of potential backgrounds. The
Cylindrical Detector, composed of a cylindrical drift chamber and a trigger
hodoscope, will be used to perform a $\mu$--$e$ conversion search with a
single-event sensitivity (see Section~\ref{sec:SES}) of $3\times 10^{-15}$, a
factor-100 improvement over SINDRUM II. COMET Phase-II is a planned upgrade to
Phase-I with higher beam intensity and better background rejection via a longer
momentum-selecting beamline. Phase-II aims to improve on the single-event
sensitivity of Phase-I by another factor of $100$ to reach a single-event
sensitivity of $2.6\times 10^{-17}$.

\subsubsection{Design}
Figure~\ref{fig:comet_schematic} shows a top-down schematic view of the COMET
experiment, laying out the different sections that make up the beamline in
Phase-I and Phase-II. In the latter, the transport solenoid is doubled to allow
more pions to decay to muons while tightening the momentum selection further. An
additional curved solenoid, the \emph{electron spectrometer,} further eliminates
particles whose momenta do not match the \SI{104.97}{\MeV} conversion signature
after the muon stopping target section, before they enter the detector system.
While Phase-I will use the StrECAL to study the beam properties, Phase-II will
use it as the conversion-searching detector system.

\section{Proton beam}\label{sec:COMET_beam}
Muons in the COMET experiment are produced from the decay of pions created in
proton collisions on a static solid target. The primary proton beam is provided
by the J-PARC facility. Protons are delivered with an energy of \SI{8}{\GeV},
picked to maximise the pion yield while minimising the production of
anti-protons, a potential background source.

The beam has a pulsed time profile: protons are grouped into \SI{100}{\ns}
bunches, each containing $16\times 10^6$ protons. Bunches are separated by
\SI{1170}{\ns}. Just after the collision, secondary particles will quickly move
down the COMET beamline and produce numerous background hits in the detector
system. This prompt and intense flooding of the detector is called the
\emph{beam flash}, and typically dies down within a few hundred nanoseconds. The
\SI{1170}{\ns} time span between two bunches, combined with the fact that muons
bound by the muon stopping target have a lifetime of \SI{864}{\ns} (see
Section~\ref{sec:stopping_target}), allows COMET to search for conversion
electrons from muons that remain bound after the beam flash has ended, and until
the next collision occurs.

% Could also add info on buckets, 4/5 time structure

% Also, timing diagram?

Stray protons arriving in the time between two bunches can contribute to the
experimental backgrounds by sending particles toward the detector region at
unexpected timings. COMET requires the J-PARC proton beam to have fewer than one
such stray proton for every 600 bunches in order to reach its sensitivity goals.
This corresponds to an extinction factor
$$
R_\mathrm{extinction} \equiv \frac{\mathrm{protons\ between\
bunches}}{\mathrm{protons\ per\ bunch}} \approx 10^{-10}.
$$

\section{Pion-production section}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter2/pion_production_section.png.pdf}
    \caption{ Cutaway view of the pion-production section. The orange arrow
        indicates the path of the proton beam while the teal arrow shows the
        direction of backward-going pions captured by the magnetic field.}
    \label{fig:pion_production_section}
\end{figure}

Pions are produced by the collision of the proton beam on a solid target made of
graphite in Phase-I, and tungsten in Phase-II. This region is permeated by a
\SI{5}{\tesla} magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid, which
confines the pions and directs them toward the transport solenoid.
Figure~\ref{fig:pion_production_section} shows a cutaway view of this
region.


Pions produced moving backward with respect to the proton beam have a lower
energy than those produced going forward, although they are not as numerous. In
COMET, it is crucial to eliminate high-energy particles in the muon beam that
could produce secondaries mimicking the conversion signal. Hence, the beamline
is positioned in the opposite direction to the proton beam such that only those
low-energy backward-moving pions are allowed into the COMET beamline.
Figure~\ref{fig:pion_momentum} illustrates this by showing that pions moving
backward with respect to the proton beam have a much lower momentum cut-off than
forward-moving pions.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chapter2/pion_mom-v2.pdf}
    \caption{ Momentum distribution of pions produced by simulating proton
    collisions with Geant4, depending on whether their initial direction is
    forward or backward with respect to the proton beam direction. }
    \label{fig:pion_momentum}
\end{figure}

\section{Transport solenoid}\label{sec:curved_solenoids}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter2/transport_solenoid.pdf}
    \caption{ Cutaway view of the Phase-I transport solenoid. The curved
        solenoid (in red) combined with collimators (in teal) select particles
        depending on their charge and momentum. }
    \label{fig:transport_solenoid}
\end{figure}

The transport solenoid is a curved pipe connecting the pion-production section
to the muon stopping section. Its purpose is twofold: it allows a larger
fraction of pions to decay along the length of the beamline, and the curved
shape combined with its magnetic field and collimators select negatively charged
particles of a specific momentum. 


The magnetic field of a curved solenoid is slightly stronger on the inside of
the curve than on the outside. Since charged particles follow helical
trajectories, this has the net effect of making them drift vertically and the
amount of drift $D$ depends on momentum $p$ according to the equation
\begin{equation*}
    D = \frac{1}{q B} \frac{s}{R} \frac{2 p^2_L + p^2_T}{2 p_L},
\end{equation*}
where $q$ is the charge, $B$ is the strength of the field along the gyration
axis, $s$ is the distance travelled along the solenoid, $R$ is the radius of the
curve, and $p_L$ and $p_T$ respectively denote momentum longitudinal and
transverse to the solenoid axis~\cite{ben_thesis}. From this expression, one can see that
oppositely charged particles drift in opposite directions, and that drift is
overall stronger for higher-momentum particles. The ratio $\frac{p_T}{p_L}$,
which defines a helical trajectory's \emph{pitch angle}, is also a major
factor in a particle's drift.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.46\textwidth}
        \centering
        \hspace{-0.8cm}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter2/drift_vs_s_0mT.pdf}
        \caption{No dipole field.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.46\textwidth}
        \centering
        \hspace{-0.8cm}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter2/drift_vs_s_0.05mT.pdf}
        \caption{\SI{0.05}{\tesla} vertical dipole field.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{ Effective drift of particles of various momenta as they progress
        along the Phase-I transport solenoid. Solid lines show drift for a pitch
        angle of \SI{45}{\degree}, and the surrounding bands show the effect of
        a $\pm \SI{10}{\degree}$ change in pitch angle on the drift. By applying
        an additional vertical magnetic field, particles of a specific momentum
        can be selected. Here, a \SI{0.05}{\tesla} dipole field allows
        particles around \SI{45}{\MeV/\clight} to stay on axis while higher- and
        lower-momentum particles drift in opposite directions, and can then be
        suppressed by collimators at the end of the transport section. }
    \label{fig:drift}
\end{figure}

The drift caused by the curved solenoid makes all particles of the same charge
move in the same direction to varying degrees depending on momentum. In order to
select particles of a specific momentum, a vertical component is added to the
magnetic field to counterbalance the drift. Selected particles thus stay on
axis, while higher- and lower-momentum particles drift off axis. With the addition
of a collimator at the end of the transport solenoid, particles with unwanted
momenta are effectively eliminated from the beam.

Figure~\ref{fig:drift} shows drift $D$ as a function of $s$, the longitudinal
distance travelled by particles along the solenoid. This illustrates how, by
adding a dipole field, particles with a momentum outside the required range can
be efficiently eliminated by collimators at the top and bottom of the beam pipe.

\section{Muon stopping target}\label{sec:stopping_target}
The purpose of the muon stopping target is to slow down and stop as many muons
as possible while not blocking the path of converted electrons. It is composed
of a series of 17 thin aluminium disks placed in the path of the muon beam. The
disks are \SI{20}{\cm} in diameter, \SI{0.2}{\mm} thick, and separated by
\SI{5}{\cm}. The stopping target is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cydet}, surrounded
by the Cylindrical Detector.

The more aluminium there is, the more muons will be stopped and allowed to
undergo conversion. However, more material means more energy lost by electrons
flying outward, hence the design of the target optimises between muon stopping
rate and acceptance of conversion electrons by the detector system.


The material of the stopping target influences the conversion rate, but also the
lifetime of a muon caught in orbit around a nucleus. A heavy target favours the
expected rate of $\mu$--$e$ conversion, however it also causes the nuclear
capture rate to be higher. In COMET, beam bunches are separated by
\SI{1.17}{\ns} and prompt backgrounds typically die off within a few hundred
nanoseconds. A muonic atom with an iron or heavier nucleus has a lifetime less
than \SI{200}{\ns}~\cite{ben_thesis}, which would be too short to allow muons to
stay bound and convert after the beam flash is over. Hence, a light target such
as aluminium, with a longer stopped muon lifetime of
\SI{864}{\ns}~\cite{PhysRevC.35.2212}, is better suited to the COMET conversion
search.

\section{Detector systems}
\subsection{StrECAL}
The StrECAL combines a straw-tube tracking detector with an electromagnetic
calorimeter for energy measurement. In COMET Phase-I, the StrECAL will serve as
a beam characterisation apparatus. It will be placed directly at the end of the
transport solenoid, without a muon stopping target, to study the composition of
the COMET beam and gain a more thorough understanding of potential backgrounds.
The collected data can also serve to validate and refine the Monte Carlo
simulation in preparation for the conversion measurement.

In COMET Phase-II, the StrECAL will serve as the detector system for the
conversion measurement. It will be placed after the electron spectrometer, a
curved solenoid section tuned to select conversion electrons, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:comet_schematic}. Figure~\ref{fig:strecal} shows a rendering of
the StrECAL detector system in Phase-II.

The Straw Tracker uses thin straw tubes as drift chambers, arranged into
circular planes. A series of stations, each one able to measure the horizontal
and vertical position of a particle, are positioned along the beam direction.
The straws have a resolution of less than \SI{100}{\um}, which allows the Straw
Tracker to reconstruct trajectories and estimate particle momenta via
time-of-flight information.

The ECAL is a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter which supplements the Straw
Tracker in measuring energy and thus identifying electrons. The ECAL uses
lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) as its scintillating crystals and
avalanche photodiodes to collect the emitted photons.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter2/strecal_recolor.png}
    \caption{ Cutaway view of the StrECAL detector. The Straw Tracker stations
    are shown in blue and the ECAL in yellow.  }
    \label{fig:strecal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{CyDet}
The Cylindrical Detector (CyDet) consists of a Cylindrical Drift Chamber (CDC)
for tracking and a Cylindrical Trigger Hodoscope (CTH) for triggering on
specific event signatures. The CyDet surrounds the muon stopping target and sits
within the detector solenoid which generates a \SI{1}{\tesla} longitudinal
magnetic field. This configuration, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cydet}, is designed
to eliminate backgrounds from the beam itself as well as low-momentum products
of the collision while maximising the acceptance of conversion electrons.
Figure~\ref{fig:cydet_signal_event} additionally shows the signature of a
simulated conversion electron inside the CyDet system.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter2/cydet_recolor.png}
    \caption{ Cutaway view of the Cylindrical Detector, composed of the
        Cylindrical Drift Chamber (in teal) and Cylindrical Trigger Hodoscope
        (in yellow). The muon stopping target disks, in purple, sit in the
        centre of the detector system. }
    \label{fig:cydet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cylindrical Drift Chamber}
The CDC is a drift chamber used to track charged particles emanating from the
muon stopping target. It has an inner radius of \SI{50}{\cm}, which, combined
with the longitudinal magnetic field, prevents charged particles produced in the
muon beam collision and whose transverse momentum is smaller than
\SI{60}{\MeV/\clight} from reaching it. In order to achieve the sensitivity goal
for Phase-I, the CDC has a momentum resolution better than
\SI{200}{\keV/\clight} in order to differentiate between conversion electrons
and electrons from the tails of the decay-in-orbit and radiative muon capture
spectra. 

% Geometry
The CDC contains 4986 \emph{sense wires} strung out longitudinally in 20
concentric layers. The wires in each layer are rotated slightly off of the
longitudinal axis, and the rotation is alternatively clockwise and
anti-clockwise from one layer to the next. This special property, called the
\emph{stereo angle}, allows the drift chamber to stereoscopically reconstruct,
within \SI{3}{mm}, the longitudinal position of a particle~\cite{ewen_thesis}. 


% Operating principle
Each sense wire is held at a potential of up to \SI{1900}{\volt} and is
surrounded by 8 grounded \emph{field wires} to generate an inward electric
field. When a charged particle ionises the gas, the field accelerates freed
electrons toward the sense wire. These electrons can gain enough energy to further
ionise the gas, leading to avalanche multiplication (see
e.g.~\cite[Chapter~6]{leo}). The avalanche produces a pulse on the sense wire,
which is acquired by the readout electronics. 


% Drift time

% The time period between the passage of the ionising charged particle and the
% ionisation products inducing a pulse on the wire depends on the \emph{drift velocity}
% of the gas, which depends on the applied voltage.

% ... not necessary?


% CDC efficiency: geometric acceptance? in signal section
% Resolution?

\subsubsection{Cylindrical Trigger Hodoscope}
The CTH consists of two \emph{modules} that line the inner wall of the CDC, one
upstream and one downstream of the muon stopping target. Each module contains
two layers of 48 partially-overlapping scintillation counters. The overlap
between counters allows the CTH to reject a large fraction of background hits,
e.g.\ from photons produced in the muon beam collision. This is done by only
accepting fourfold-coincident events, where four neighbouring counters (two in
the inner layer, two in the outer layer) are hit in a short \SI{10}{\ns} time
span. Figure~\ref{fig:cydet_signal_event} shows how a conversion electron might
produce such a fourfold coincidence.

The CTH provides an online triggering mechanism which significantly reduces the
number of background events accepted by the CyDet system.

% Resolution?
The CTH counters have a time resolution better than \SI{1}{\ns}.

% Trigger window
In order to suppress the large amount of hits from products of the beam
flash, the CTH defines a trigger window which starts \SI{500}{\ns} after the
proton beam collision and ends just before the next collision occurs.


\subsection{Cosmic ray veto}
The COMET experiment hall is constantly irradiated by muons produced in the
atmosphere by cosmic rays. The cosmic ray veto (CRV) is an additional active
detector which will surround the CyDet and StrECAL detector systems. Its purpose
is to identify events induced by cosmic muons rather than by the COMET beam, and
thus reduce the probability that such events will be mistaken for the conversion
signal.

% Do we need to describe the CRV in detail? Can we just say it needs to have X
% efficiency. 
% The CRV is composed of four layers of scintillator. \hl{Not all of
%it. GRPC.}

\section{Conversion signature}
Conversion electrons are mono-energetic and emitted isotropically by muons
stopped in the target disks. In the magnetic field of the detector solenoid,
they have a helical trajectory which can be reconstructed by the CDC or Straw
Tracker.

% Timing
A conversion signal can occur at any timing when muons are bound inside the muon
stopping target. 

% Trigger criteria
% Depends on det system. Phase-I vs Phase-II? Only Phase-I?


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{chapter2/cydet_signal_track_v2.pdf}
    \caption{ Conversion electron trajectory as observed by the Cylindrical
    Detector. \hl{Effect of stereo angle, fourfold coincidence, tracking, TODO
    make dots smaller and have consistent colour (it's a vscode bug actually)}.}
    \label{fig:cydet_signal_event}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cydet_signal_event} shows a simulated conversion electron going
through the Cylindrical Detector.


\section{Experimental backgrounds}\label{sec:backgrounds}
The COMET experiment is specifically designed to be sensitive to a $\mu$--$e$
conversion signal, i.e.\ to eliminate as many sources of background as possible
while making sure to notice the process if it does occur. 

Observing $\mu$--$e$ conversion requires the production of an intense source of
muons which must be bound to atomic nuclei. COMET uses a proton beam from the
J-PARC main ring.


The COMET experiment will produce a muon beam and direct it toward a static
aluminium target to slow down and stop the muons. As discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:sm_backgrounds}, a bound muon can undergo decay in orbit (DIO)
or nuclear capture.

% Backgrounds = signal contamination. Backgrounds do not enter the equation for
% SES, but SES involves quality cut factors whose purpose is to lower background
% rates. The goal is to show that background rate << 1, only then SES makes
% sense since we've shown that we can actually detect a single event with little
% doubt that it's a conversion signal.

% Antiprotons

\section{Sensitivity}\label{sec:SES}

\hl{What factors go into acceptance? Discuss them first before defining SES?}

From the total number of stopped muons and net signal acceptance of the detector
system, one can define the single event sensitivity (SES) of COMET as
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{SES} = \frac{1}{N_\mu \  A_{\mu-e} \  
    \mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} \  f_\mathrm{coherent}}
\end{equation}
where $N_\mu$ is the number of stopped muons, $A_{\mu-e}$ is the signal
acceptance, $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture}$ is the branching ratio of nuclear
capture, and $f_\mathrm{coherent}$ is the fraction of conversions estimated to
occur coherently and leave the nucleus in its ground state.

COMET Phase-I with the Cylindrical Detector is expected to run for 150 days
corresponding to a total number of stopped muons of $N_\mu = 1.5 \times
10^{16}$. Using the values from the Phase-I technical design
report~\cite{the_comet_collaboration_comet_2020}: $A_{\mu-e} = 0.041$,
$\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{capture} = 0.61$ and $f_\mathrm{coherent} = 0.9$, the
single event sensitivity of Phase-I is $3 \times 10^{-15}$.



% The choice of target material directly influences how frequently high-energy
% electrons will be produced by these processes, and hence contributes in
% setting the maximum experimental sensitivity.

% This should go into the COMET section as these are specific to COMET and/or
% specifically addressed by the COMET design.
% Background events can be classified into three categories: intrinsic,
% beam-related, and cosmic ray-induced.

% Beam-related backgrounds come from impurities in the high-intensity muon beam.
% The specifics of the COMET beam and how these backgrounds are alleviated is
% discussed in Section~\ref{sec:COMET_beam}.

% Cosmic rays typically produce muons with a wide range of energies in the
% atmosphere which
