+ Requirements: high sensitivity to signal, efficient rejection of backgrounds
 + -> Need intense muon beam, pulsed, and detector design must avoid backgrounds
+ TIMING of signal (muon lifetime)
+ Proton beam energy: why 8 Gev -> antiproton production
+ Intensity: beam current, beam power, POTs per second
+ Send backward-going secondaries to detector, discard the main part of secondaries (forward-going)
+ Curved solenoid + dipole field (by tilting coils, see Krikler)
+ Stopping target -> why Al
+ Bunch structure, extinction
+ Phase-I detectors: StrECAL and CyDet

COMET (COherent Muon-to-Electron Transition) is a muon-beam experiment aiming to
observe the muon-to-electron conversion process, or at least to constrain its
branching ratio to an unprecedented upper limit. Currently being built at the
J-PARC facility in Tokai, Japan, its physics program will be run in a two-stage
approach, Phase-I and Phase-II. These two phases are expected to improve our
sensitivity to the conversion signal by factors of 100 and \num{10000},
respectively, with respect to the current world-leading measurement conducted at
the SINDRUM II experiment~\cite{Bertl:2006up}.




The design of the COMET experiment is heavily angled toward suppressing
backgrounds to the $\mu$--$e$ conversion signal. Understanding the background
sources and their properties is key in making sense of the experimental design.

\section{Experimental backgrounds}\label{sec:backgrounds}

% The choice of target material directly influences how frequently high-energy
% electrons will be produced by these processes, and hence contributes in
% setting the maximum experimental sensitivity.

% This should go into the COMET section as these are specific to COMET and/or
% specifically addressed by the COMET design.
% Background events can be classified into three categories: intrinsic,
% beam-related, and cosmic ray-induced.

% Beam-related backgrounds come from impurities in the high-intensity muon beam.
% The specifics of the COMET beam and how these backgrounds are alleviated is
% discussed in Section~\ref{sec:COMET_beam}.

% Cosmic rays typically produce muons with a wide range of energies in the
% atmosphere which
