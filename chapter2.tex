The COMET (COherent Muon-to-Electron Transition) project \hl{project?} is a muon-beam experiment aiming to observe the muon-to-electron conversion process, or at least to constrain its branching ratio to an unprecedented upper limit.
Currently being built at the J-PARC facility in Tokai, Japan, its physics program will be run in a two-stage approach, Phase-I and Phase-II. These two phases are expected to improve our sensitivity to the conversion signal by factors of 100 and \num{10000}, respectively, with respect to the current world-leading measurement conducted at the SINDRUM II experiment~\cite{Bertl:2006up}.
