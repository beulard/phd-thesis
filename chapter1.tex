The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is possibly the most successful
mathematical model of physical phenomena so far. It provides accurate
predictions for all observable interactions between known elementary particles.

% The very start of this chapter should introduce HEP concepts like the muon and
% what it is, how it relates to the SM, what is the SM.

% This thesis concerns itself with addressing some of the challenges faced in the
% simulation of particles within the experimental setup of the COMET experiment.

% However before we are able to dive into the main topics, it is necessary to
% discuss the purpose of the experiment, how it emerges from the current state of
% our knowledge of elementary particle physics, and the steps taken to get there.

% Explain the SM. Something like
% The Standard Model is the theory at the heart of modern particle physics. Built
% upon special relativity and quantum mechanics, it describes the interactions
% between elementary particles and allows physicists to predict the outcome of
% interactions and decays to a previously unattainable precision. Little evidence
% so far has been able to contradict the formulation of the Standard Model,
% despite many fundamental questions remaining unanswered, such as the nature of
% dark matter, the reason for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, or
% the existence of exactly three generations of leptons and quarks.


\section{Discovery of the muon}
The first traces of muons were observed around 1937 by three experiments
investigating the nature of cosmic ray-induced particle
showers~\cite{PhysRev.51.884, PhysRev.52.1198, PhysRev.52.1003}. 
In addition, one analysis was able to estimate the mass of the discovered
particle at 130 times that of the electron. 
In 1935, Yukawa predicted the existence of a particle with a similar mass whose role
was to carry the strong force and bind atomic nuclei
together~\cite{10.1143/PTPS.1.1}. Hence the muon and Yukawa's particle were
originally believed to be one and the same particle, and it was only when
Yukawa's meson (now called $\pi$, for primary) was observed decaying into a muon,
that the two particles were completely disambiguated~\cite{LATTES1947}.

It was the fact that the muon appeared as nothing but a heavy electron which
prompted Rabi to ask ``who ordered that?'' in response to its discovery. In
fact, the Standard Model still cannot give a satisfactory answer to this
question as it does not motivate the existence of three generations of
elementary particles. As far as the SM can explain, there is no fundamental reason
for the existence of distinct flavours.

\section{The muon in the Standard Model}
% 
The SM identifies the muon as the second-generation charged lepton, meaning it
is a fermion with identical quantum numbers (aside from flavour) as the electron
and tau lepton. The only way for a muon to decay in a vacuum is through the weak
force. The diagram for muon decay is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:weak_decay}.

        c -- [anti fermion] f2 [particle=\(\overline \nu_{e}\)],
        c -- [fermion] f3 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
    };

% mu -> e gamma
The process $\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma$ is in principle kinematically allowed
as well, and the SM contains no symmetry which would forbid such a flavour
change. However, it has never been observed experimentally. Since
1948~\cite{PhysRev.73.257}, searches for ${\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma}$ have
demonstrated that it does not occur at any observable rate: the current upper
limit on its branching ratio measured by the MEG experiment is
$10^{-13}$~\cite{mori2016final}.

In the quark sector, generations can mix via weak interactions: the
CKM matrix accurately describes how strongly each quark flavour couples
to the others. %~\cite{PhysRevLett.10.531, 10.1143/PTP.49.652}.
For leptons on the other hand, it is
only through neutrino oscillations, discovered by the Super-Kamiokande
experiment~\cite{PhysRevLett.81.1562}, that flavours have been observed to mix. 
Flavour-changing neutrino oscillations allow a new channel for ${\mu \rightarrow
e + \gamma}$, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mu_e_nu_osc}. However, the branching ratio
calculated for this process using the upper limit on neutrino masses is given
by:
$$
\mathcal{BR}(\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma) = \frac{3\alpha}{32\pi} \left|\ \sum_{i=2, 3} U^*_{\mu i} U_{e i} 
\frac{\Delta m^2_{i1}}{M^2_W}  \ \right| ^2 \approx 10^{-54},
$$
where $U$ is the PMNS matrix, $\Delta m^2_{ij}$ is the mass-squared difference between the
$i$-th and $j$-th neutrino mass eigenstates, and $M_W$ is the $W$-boson
mass~\cite{BERNSTEIN201327}.
Any evidence that the ${\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma}$ process occurs at a higher
rate than this would indicate that another channel involving charged lepton
flavour violation (CLFV) is responsible.

In the presence of matter, there are additional processes which could be
investigated to find charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV), as shown in Fig.

\section{Charged lepton flavour violation}
Quark generations are known to mix (CMK).
Neutral leptons (neutrinos) are known to mix (PMNS, osc).
Charged leptons have never been seen to mix. Why?
