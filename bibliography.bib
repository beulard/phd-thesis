The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly Ô¨Åne details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., {CELEBA} images at 10242. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised {CIFAR}10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating {GAN} results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the {CELEBA} dataset.},

  abstract     = {Despite the success of Lipschitz regularization in stabilizing {GAN} training, the exact reason of its effectiveness remains poorly understood. The direct effect of \$K\$-Lipschitz regularization is to restrict the \$L2\$-norm of the neural network gradient to be smaller than a threshold \$K\$ (e.g., \$K=1\$) such that \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}nabla f{\textbackslash}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}leq K\$. In this work, we uncover an even more important effect of Lipschitz regularization by examining its impact on the loss function: It degenerates {GAN} loss functions to almost linear ones by restricting their domain and interval of attainable gradient values. Our analysis shows that loss functions are only successful if they are degenerated to almost linear ones. We also show that loss functions perform poorly if they are not degenerated and that a wide range of functions can be used as loss function as long as they are sufficiently degenerated by regularization. Basically, Lipschitz regularization ensures that all loss functions effectively work in the same way. Empirically, we verify our proposition on the {MNIST}, {CIFAR}10 and {CelebA} datasets.},

To aid in a fair and thorough comparison, we design a benchmark with 7 simulated and 8 real datasets and several Bayesian network baselines. {TGAN} outperforms Bayesian methods on most of the real datasets whereas other deep learning methods could not.},

Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our {PReLU} networks ({PReLU}-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the {ImageNet} 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the {ILSVRC} 2014 winner ({GoogLeNet}, 6.66\%).

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are a family of generative models that do not minimize a single training criterion. Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost. {GANs} are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players' parameters. One useful approach for the theory of {GANs} is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During {GAN} training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of {GAN} training as divergence minimization. Specifically, we demonstrate that {GANs} are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that {GAN} training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.},

The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture.

Despite their successes, the most appropriate choice of a {GAN} network architecture is still not well understood. {GAN} models for image synthesis have adopted a deep convolutional network architecture, which eliminates or minimizes the use of fully connected and pooling layers in favor of convolution layers in the generator and discriminator of {GANs}. In this paper, we demonstrate that a convolution network architecture utilizing deep fully connected layers and pooling layers can be more effective than the traditional convolution-only architecture, and we propose {FCC}-{GAN}, a fully connected and convolutional {GAN} architecture.

  abstract     = {The precise modeling of subatomic particle interactions and propagation through matter is paramount for the advancement of nuclear and particle physics searches and precision measurements. The most computationally expensive step in the simulation pipeline of a typical experiment at the Large Hadron Collider ({LHC}) is the detailed modeling of the full complexity of physics processes that govern the motion and evolution of particle showers inside calorimeters. We introduce {\textbackslash}textsc\{{CaloGAN}\}, a new fast simulation technique based on generative adversarial networks ({GANs}). We apply these neural networks to the modeling of electromagnetic showers in a longitudinally segmented calorimeter, and achieve speedup factors comparable to or better than existing full simulation techniques on {CPU} (\$100{\textbackslash}times\$-\$1000{\textbackslash}times\$) and even faster on {GPU} (up to \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}times\$). There are still challenges for achieving precision across the entire phase space, but our solution can reproduce a variety of geometric shower shape properties of photons, positrons and charged pions. This represents a significant stepping stone toward a full neural network-based detector simulation that could save significant computing time and enable many analyses now and in the future.},

  abstract = {Simulations of particle showers in calorimeters are computationally time-consuming, as they have to reproduce both energy depositions and their considerable fluctuations. A new approach to ultra-fast simulations is generative models where all calorimeter energy depositions are generated simultaneously. We use GEANT4 simulations of an electron beam impinging on a multi-layer electromagnetic calorimeter for adversarial training of a generator network and a critic network guided by the Wasserstein distance. The generator is constrained during the training such that the generated showers show the expected dependency on the initial energy and the impact position. It produces realistic calorimeter energy depositions, fluctuations and correlations which we demonstrate in distributions of typical calorimeter observables. In most aspects, we observe that generated calorimeter showers reach the level of showers as simulated with the GEANT4 program.}

  abstract     = {We present a study for the generation of events from a physical process with deep generative models. The simulation of physical processes requires not only the production of physical events, but also to ensure these events occur with the correct frequencies. We investigate the feasibility of learning the event generation and the frequency of occurrence with Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) and Variational Autoencoders ({VAEs}) to produce events like Monte Carlo generators. We study three processes: a simple two-body decay, the processes \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}to Z {\textbackslash}to l{\textasciicircum}+l{\textasciicircum}-\$ and \$p p {\textbackslash}to t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\} \$ including the decay of the top quarks and a simulation of the detector response. We find that the tested {GAN} architectures and the standard {VAE} are not able to learn the distributions precisely. By buffering density information of encoded Monte Carlo events given the encoder of a {VAE} we are able to construct a prior for the sampling of new events from the decoder that yields distributions that are in very good agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated several orders of magnitude faster. Applications of this work include generic density estimation and sampling, targeted event generation via a principal component analysis of encoded ground truth data, anomaly detection and more efficient importance sampling, e.g. for the phase space integration of matrix elements in quantum field theories.},

Recently, generative machine learning models based on deep neural networks have shown promise in speeding up this task by several orders of magnitude. We investigate the use of a new architecture ‚Äî the Bounded Information Bottleneck Autoencoder ‚Äî for modelling electromagnetic showers in the central region of the {SiliconTungsten} calorimeter of the proposed International Large Detector. Combined with a novel second post-processing network, this approach achieves an accurate simulation of diÔ¨Äerential distributions including for the Ô¨Årst time the shape of the minimum-ionizing-particle peak compared to a full {GEANT}4 simulation for a highgranularity calorimeter with 27k simulated channels. The results are validated by comparing to established architectures. Our results further strengthen the case of using generative networks for fast simulation and demonstrate that physically relevant diÔ¨Äerential distributions can be described with high accuracy.},

While common implementations of these algorithms employ L\$\_2\$ regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by {\textbackslash}emph\{decoupling\} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard {SGD} and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with {SGD} with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in {TensorFlow} and {PyTorch}; the complete source code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/loshchil/{AdamW}-and-{SGDW}},

In order to adequately model the speciÔ¨Åc characteristics of insurance data, we use {GAN} architectures adapted for multi-categorical data: a Wassertein {GAN} with gradient penalty ({MC}-{WGAN}-{GP}), a conditional tabular {GAN} ({CTGAN}) and a Mixed Numerical and Categorical DiÔ¨Äerentially Private {GAN} ({MNCDP}-{GAN}).

We compare the three diÔ¨Äerent {GANs} on various aspects: ability to reproduce the original data structure and predictive models, privacy, and ease of use. We Ô¨Ånd that the {MC}-{WGAN}-{GP} synthesizes the best data, the {CTGAN} is the easiest to use, and the {MNCDP}-{GAN} guarantees diÔ¨Äerential privacy.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

We develop a novel architecture that can be applied to existing latent vector based {GAN} structures that allows them to generate on-the-Ô¨Çy images of any size. Existing {GAN} for image generation requires uniform images of matching dimensions. However, publicly available datasets, such as {ImageNet} contain thousands of diÔ¨Äerent sizes. Resizing image causes deformations and changing the image data, whereas as our network does not require this preprocessing step. We make signiÔ¨Åcant changes to the standard data loading techniques to enable any size image to be loaded for training. We also modify the network in two ways, by adding multiple inputs and a novel dynamic resizing layer. Finally we make adjustments to the discriminator to work on multiple resolutions. These changes can allow multiple resolution datasets to be trained on without any resizing, if memory allows. We validate our results on the {ISIC} 2019 skin lesion dataset. We demonstrate our method can successfully generate realistic images at diÔ¨Äerent sizes without issue, preserving and understanding spatial relationships, while maintaining feature relationships. We will release the source codes upon paper acceptance.},

The data reflect two-dimensional projections of spatially distributed signal patterns with a broad spectrum of applications. As an example, we use an observatory to detect cosmic ray-induced air showers with a ground-based array of particle detectors. First we investigate a method of generating detector patterns with variable signal strengths while constraining the primary particle energy. We then present a technique to refine simulated time traces of detectors to match corresponding data distributions. With this method we demonstrate that training a deep network with refined data-like signal traces leads to a more precise energy reconstruction of data events compared to training with the originally simulated traces.}

The experimental sensitivity goal for this process in the Phase-I experiment is \$3.1{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$, or 90\% upper limit of a branching ratio of \$7{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$, which is a factor of 100 improvement over the existing limit. The expected number of background events is 0.032. To achieve the target sensitivity and background level, the 3.2 {kW} 8 {GeV} proton beam from J-{PARC} will be used. Two types of detectors, {CyDet} and {StrECAL}, will be used for detecting the \${\textbackslash}mu\$‚Äì\$e\$ conversion events, and for measuring the beam-related background events in view of the Phase-{II} experiment, respectively. Results from simulation on signal and background estimations are also described.},

  abstract  = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating realistic images with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the 'Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance" (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP) outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are innovative techniques for learning generative models of complex data distributions from samples. Despite remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, one of their major shortcomings is the fact that in practice, they tend to produce samples with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon, known as mode collapse, has been the main focus of several recent advances in {GANs}. Yet there is little understanding of why mode collapse happens and why recently proposed approaches are able to mitigate mode collapse. We propose a principled approach to handling mode collapse, which we call packing. The main idea is to modify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the same class, either real or artiÔ¨Åcially generated. We borrow analysis tools from binary hypothesis testing‚Äîin particular the seminal result of Blackwell [6]‚Äîto prove a fundamental connection between packing and mode collapse. We show that packing naturally penalizes generators with mode collapse, thereby favoring generator distributions with less mode collapse during the training process. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing provides signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in practice as well.},

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics currently provides our best description of fundamental particles and their interactions. The theory predicts that the different charged leptons, the electron, muon and tau, have identical electroweak interaction strengths. Previous measurements have shown that a wide range of particle decays are consistent with this principle of lepton universality. This article presents evidence for the breaking of lepton universality in beauty-quark decays, with a significance of 3.1 standard deviations, based on proton--proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are of processes in which a beauty meson transforms into a strange meson with the emission of either an electron and a positron, or a muon and an antimuon. If confirmed by future measurements, this violation of lepton universality would imply physics beyond the standard model, such as a new fundamental interaction between quarks and leptons.},

  abstract = {Charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is a clear signal of new physics; it directly addresses the physics of flavor and of generations. The search for CLFV has continued from the early 1940s, when the muon was identified as a separate particle, until today. Certainly in the LHC era the motivations for continued searches are clear and have been covered in many reviews. This review is focused on the experimental history with a view toward how these searches might progress. We examine the status of searches for charged lepton flavor violation in the muon, tau, and other channels, and then examine the prospects for new efforts over the next decade. Finally, we examine what paths might be taken after the conclusion of upcoming experiments and what facilities might be required.}

The high rate of up to 108 muon decays per second and the low momenta of the decay electrons and positrons pose a unique set of challenges, which we tackle using an ultra thin tracking detector based on high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensors combined with scintillating fibres and tiles for precise timing measurements.}

  abstract = {One of the medium energy hadron‚Äìnucleus interaction models in the Geant4 simulation toolkit is based partly on the Bertini intranuclear cascade model. Since its initial appearance in the toolkit, this model has been largely re-written in order to extend its physics capabilities and to reduce its memory footprint. Physics improvements include extensions in applicable energy range and incident particle types, and improved hadron‚Äìnucleon cross-sections and angular distributions. Interfaces have also been developed which allow the model to be coupled with other Geant4 models at lower and higher energies. The inevitable speed reductions due to enhanced physics have been mitigated by memory and CPU efficiency improvements. Details of these improvements, along with selected comparisons of the model to data, are discussed.}

Recent developments in the MARS15 physical models of hadron, heavy-ion and lepton interactions with nuclei and atoms include a new nuclear cross section library, a model for soft pion production, the cascade-exciton model, the quark gluon string models, deuteron-nucleus and neutrino-nucleus interaction models, detailed description of negative hadron and muon absorption and a unified treatment of muon, charged hadron and heavy-ion electromagnetic interactions with matter. New algorithms are implemented into the code and thoroughly benchmarked against experimental data. The code capabilities to simulate cascades and generate a variety of results in complex media have been also enhanced. Other changes in the current version concern the improved photo- and electro-production of hadrons and muons, improved algorithms for the 3-body decays, particle tracking in magnetic fields, synchrotron radiation by electrons and muons, significantly extended histograming capabilities and material description, and improved computational performance. In addition to direct energy deposition calculations, a new set of fluence-to-dose conversion factors for all particles including neutrino are built into the code. The code includes new modules for calculation of Displacement-per-Atom and nuclide inventory. The powerful ROOT geometry and visualization model implemented in MARS15 provides a large set of geometrical elements with a possibility of producing composite shapes and assemblies and their 3D visualization along with a possible import/export of geometry descriptions created by other codes (via the GDML format) and CAD systems (via the STEP format). The built-in MARS-MAD Beamline Builder (MMBLB) was redesigned for use with the ROOT geometry package that allows a very efficient and highly-accurate description, modeling and visualization of beam loss induced effects in arbitrary beamlines and accelerator lattices. The MARS15 code includes links to the MCNP-family codes for neutron and photon production and transport below 20 MeV, to the ANSYS code for thermal and stress analyses and to the STRUCT code for multi-turn particle tracking in large synchrotrons and collider rings.}

  abstract = {In recent investigations with the photographic method1,2, it has been shown that slow charged particles of small mass, present as a component of the cosmic radiation at high altitudes, can enter nuclei and produce disintegrations with the emission of heavy particles. It is convenient to apply the term `meson' to any particle with a mass intermediate between that of a proton and an electron. In continuing our experiments we have found evidence of mesons which, at the end of their range, produce secondary mesons. We have also observed transmutations in which slow mesons are ejected from disintegrating nuclei. Several features of these processes remain to be elucidated, but we present the following account of the experiments because the results appear to bear closely on the important problem of developing a satisfactory meson theory of nuclear forces.},

The muon is subsequently captured by the nucleus and, due to its much higher mass compared to the electron, orbits the nucleus at very small distances. During this atomic capture process, the muon emits characteristic X-rays during its cascade down to the ground state. The energies of these X-rays reveal the muonic energy level scheme, from which properties like the nuclear charge radius or its quadrupole moment can be extracted. While almost all stable elements have been examined using muons, probing highly radioactive atoms has so far not been possible. The muX experiment has developed a technique based on transfer reaction inside a high-pressure hydrogen/deuterium gas cell to examine targets available only in microgram quantities.},

More experimental data are needed to constrain and guide possible generalizations of the standard model of particle physics, and reveal the mechanism behind nonzero neutrino masses. Here, the physics associated with searches for the violation of lepton-flavor conservation in charged-lepton processes and the violation of lepton-number conservation in nuclear physics processes is summarized. In the first part, several aspects of charged-lepton flavor violation are discussed, especially its sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics. The discussion concentrates mostly on rare processes involving muons and electrons. In the second part, the status of the conservation of total lepton number is discussed. The discussion here concentrates on current and future probes of this apparent law of Nature via searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is also the most sensitive probe of the potential Majorana nature of neutrinos.}

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics describes the vast majority of experiments and observations involving elementary particles. Any deviation from its predictions would be a sign of new, fundamental physics. One long-standing discrepancy concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a measure of the magnetic field surrounding that particle. Standard-model predictions1 exhibit disagreement with measurements2 that is tightly scattered around 3.7 standard deviations. Today, theoretical and measurement errors are comparable; however, ongoing and planned experiments aim to reduce the measurement error by a factor of four. Theoretically, the dominant source of error is the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization (LO-HVP) contribution. For the upcoming measurements, it is essential to evaluate the prediction for this contribution with independent methods and to reduce its uncertainties. The most precise, model-independent determinations so far rely on dispersive techniques, combined with measurements of the cross-section of electron--positron annihilation into hadrons3--6. To eliminate our reliance on these experiments, here we use ab initio quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics simulations to compute the LO-HVP contribution. We reach sufficient precision to discriminate between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the predictions of dispersive methods. Our result favours the experimentally measured value over those obtained using the dispersion relation. Moreover, the methods used and developed in this work will enable further increased precision as more powerful computers become available.},

  abstract = {We have implemented the reverse/adjoint Monte Carlo method into Geant4. In this method the primary particles are tracked backward from the sensitive part of the geometry till the external source surface by following the reverse processes. By this way the computing time is spent only for tracks that are contributing to the tallies and the reverse Monte Carlo method is much more rapid than the normal forward Monte Carlo method for simulation cases where the sensitive part is small compared to the rest of the geometry and compared to the extended external source. In this paper we first present the theoretical principles of the Reverse Monte Carlo method. Then we describe how this method and the reverse processes have been implemented into Geant4. Finally we compare and discuss the simulation results obtained with the reverse and forward Monte Carlo modes in Geant4.}

Backward Monte-Carlo allows exclusive sampling of a Ô¨Ånal state by reversing the simulation Ô¨Çow. In practice it can be made analogous to an adjoint Monte-Carlo, though it is more versatile for muon transport. A backward Monte-Carlo was implemented as a dedicated muon transport library: PUMAS. It is shown for case studies relevant for muography imaging that the implementations of forward and backward Monte-Carlo schemes agree to better than 1 %.},
