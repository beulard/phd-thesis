\chapter{Fake Monte Carlo data generation}
\begin{markdown}
---

- GAN theory [Goodfellow, WGAN, WGAN-GP]
- Creation of dataset from Monte Carlo simulation
 - /!\ This involves reconstructible vs noise-like classification, might be long
 - Pre-processing
- GAN design, basic architecture, softmax for classes [WGAN-GP]
- GAN extensions, embedding? analogy with text?
