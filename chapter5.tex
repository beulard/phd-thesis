\chapter{Backward Monte Carlo simulation for cosmic ray events}

\begin{markdown}
---

- Backward MC theory, with diagram showing analogy inner/outer boundary sampling [VNiess]
- Perhaps some background with adjoint MC refs

---

1. Intro to BMC: relation to adjoint MC (find refs), maybe diagram

2. Physics: how we use BMC to determine rates of cosmic events: equations for
flux, sampling PDF, BMC weights, topography map of J-PARC

3. Integration into ICEDUST: implementation of sampling methods, event loop, output to
oaRooTracker format

3. Actual estimation of background rate in Phase-I, maybe just quoting V's
result
